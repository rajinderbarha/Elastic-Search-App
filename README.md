:sparkles:**Follow the YouTube episodes/blogs in sequential order and use this repo as a supplementary resource. The videos/blogs contain the link to the corresponding repo branch.**:sparkles:

## Running the App locally
If you wish to download the project, follow these instructions.

### Downloading the repo
Go to the page of the branch you wish to download.

Click on the `Code` button(blue box) to display the drop down menu.

Click on the `Download Zip` option(red box).

Once the code is downloaded, double click on the file to unzip it. 

Move the unzipped file to your desired location.

I recommend that you change the name to something shorter as the downloaded project will have the following name:

*beginners-guide-to-creating-a-full-stack-JavaScript-app-with-Elasticsearch-name-of-the-branch.zip*

Cd into the project directory.

:sparkles:**Depending on which episode/blog/branch you are working on, the corresponding repo will contain only the server side code or both the server and client side code.**:sparkles:

### Don't forget!
This project requires creating an Elastic Cloud deployment and adding the Elastic Cloud access credentials to the `config/default.json` file.

The steps on how to accomplish these tasks are outlined in the following blogs:
- [Part 3: Create an Elastic Cloud deployment](https://dev.to/lisahjung/part-3-create-an-elastic-cloud-deployment-36bn)
- [Part 4: Securely connect Node.js server to Elastic Cloud](https://dev.to/lisahjung/part-4-securely-connect-nodejs-server-to-elastic-cloud-4f22)

:sparkles:**When running this project, be sure to update the `config/default.json` file with your access credentials before running the project!**:sparkles:

### Start the server

Execute these commands in the terminal in the following order. 
```javascript
//in the project directory
npm install
npm start
```

### Start the client

Execute these commands *in a new terminal* in the following order. 
```javascript
//in the project directory
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Final outcome:

The browser will display the client.
When you click on each select option, it will render the corresponding drop down menu. It will also display a form where a user can type in the location of interest.
